point of sale system
Razor Retail is an extremely innovative Point of Sale system. It has been conceived to provide you with all the features that standard, currently available, POS systems have, but with the possibility of extending and expanding features as your business and technology grows.
Razor Retail is a Ruby-on-Rails based Point of Sale system that is intended for standalone or web deployment. It can be deployed like any standard Rails application, and will work in all modern browsers.
To facilitate desktop deployment, all the components for Razor Retail are packaged as Debian .deb packages and can easily be installed on any Debian based distribution.
